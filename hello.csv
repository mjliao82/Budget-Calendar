This is Mike, and here are the set up instructions for the envionment.

Everything backend will be in Python 3.9.13, u can download it in vscode or the offical website. 

Ryan and I had trouble coding in different versions and it caused a lot of unnecessary trouble
To ensure the version consistency, we'll be using a virtual environment called virtualenv 

It sounds ode but I promise it will save us from a lot of dumb stuff
It is also not that ode at all

To open terminal in vscode if you're using it, press: control  ` 

open terminal and type: pip install virtualenv 


I included a requirement.txt file, go into it and click install

it will create a vitural env I created for this project.

on the left in the file expolorer will have a .venv

right click and open integrated terminal and it is activated in the desigated terminal

We need to activate it because that's where all of the built in packages will be installed in
Note that whatever we install, say pandas or flask/react whatever, it will only be in the virtual environment, not in your local machine.

We'll experiment with flask as the backend tool for now, so install flask is a must.
In budenv in terminal, type: pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy. 
If it is already importing with no problem, no need for that.

If it is activated, you should see (budenv) on the path on your command line.

take a break, that was ode amount of info. 

For future imports, if the packages is not installed, it will bug out, just pip it in command line.
In the terminal, type: pip install PackageName  #just make sure it's in virtualenv 


To commit to github after u clone the repo:
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push 


Thank you, happy hacking,

Michael
