This is Mike, and here are the set up instructions for the envionment.

Everything backend will be in Python 3.9.13, u can download it in vscode or the offical website. 

The project is programmed in a virutal env, every import that needs to be install are installed within.
I made a requirements.txt that has everything this project needs so far, including the virutal env.

You must activate the virtual env to run app.py to have any effects, I believe if u run it in vscode with everything install will be fine.

If u want to run it by just typing the path to the project, you have to activate it.
The activation script is .venv/bin/activate after making to the project directory in the path.

The run_app.py is the automation script to run the website but it does not include the activation part.

I (Mike) included that part in the automation sh file for my own computer.



To commit to github after u clone the repo:
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push 


Thank you, happy hacking,

Michael
